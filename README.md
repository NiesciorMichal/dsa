# Shortest Path Algo

Made with the help of freeCodeCamp: Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algorithm.

shortest_path.py : has the hardcoded graph

to change the start node and target, function call should be changed:

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    shortest_path(graph=my_graph, start='A', target='F')
```

for start in 'B' and end in 'D':

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    shortest_path(graph=my_graph, start='B', target='D')
```
