# Shortest Path Algo

Made with the help of freeCodeCamp: Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algorithm.

shortest_path.py : has the hardcoded graph

to change the start node and target, function call should be changed:

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    shortest_path(graph=my_graph, start='A', target='F')
```

for start in 'B' and end in 'D':

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    shortest_path(graph=my_graph, start='B', target='D')
```

# Sudoku Solver

sudoku_solver.py: like the name says. Maybe not optimal but focused on OOP and functional programming.

# Binary Search

The search range is represented by the left and right indices that start from both ends of the array and move towards each other as we search. When moving the index, we discard elements and shrink the search range.

Time Complexity: O(log(n))
